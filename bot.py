bot.py

The entry point you actually run: `python bot.py`.

What it does, in order:
  1. Creates a discord.py Bot instance with the permissions ("intents") it needs
  2. Attaches a shared Database object so every cog can query SQLite
  3. Loads each cog (extension) from the cogs/ folder
  4. Syncs slash commands with Discord so they show up in the / menu
  5. Logs in and starts listening for events
